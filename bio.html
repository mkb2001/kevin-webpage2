    <div class="panel1">     
        <p> I go by the names of <strong >Kevin Mugarura Byarugaba.</strong> I am a student of Makerere University offering 
            Software Engineering(1st year). I grew up in Kampala City in a family of six kids. I went to pre school here
            -in this crazy city- for most of my 20 year old life. I am born to academic parents, most 
            of my academic life has been smooth. I wouldn't leave without two things in my life: a book and a computer.
